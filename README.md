# Craftpp

This library is set of useful building blocks in C++ that
improves safety of development (like maybe::Maybe, result::Result)
or promotes type-oriented develeopment (like types::Tagged).

Initially this library was developed as part of freewebrtc but
finally I found that it can have it's own value as indenendent
library.
